    "到目前为止，我们已经学习了如何构建多智能体系统中的核心组件——如 Agents、Teams 和 Termination Conditions。\n",
    "在真实应用中（尤其是 Web 应用），我们经常需要：\n",
    "\n",
    "保存这些组件的运行状态到磁盘，以及\n",
    "\n",
    "在之后重新加载这些状态，以便恢复中断的会话或继续未完成的任务。\n",
    "\n",
    "这是因为许多 Web 应用是无状态的（stateless）：每次请求不会保留上次运行的内存数据。为了让系统“记得”对话进展，我们必须使用持久化机制保存组件状态。\n",

Let me start by recalling some key facts about the lake. It\\'s one of the largest lakes in the world by volume, located in Africa, specifically in the East African Rift. I should mention its size or depth maybe. Also, it\\'s home to a lot of endemic species, so that\\'s a unique point. The surrounding countries are Tanzania, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Zambia. Maybe include something about the countries or the local culture? Also, the lake is known for its clear waters and the presence of certain fish like sardines and tilapia. I should make it concise but vivid. Let me think of some imagery: the lake\\'s vastness, the wildlife, perhaps the sunset or the landscape around it. Need to make sure each line flows well and has a poetic feel. Maybe start with the lake\\'s geographical feature, then move to wildlife, and end with a cultural or scenic element. Check for rhyme scheme. Since it\\'s three lines, maybe a simple rhyme like AB or ABA. Let me try:\\n\\n\"Stretching deep where African skies meet,  \\nTanganyika guards ancient secrets beneath.  \\nIts waters cradle life, lore, and the light of a thousand dreams.\"\\n\\nHmm, the first line mentions the location and depth. Second line refers to the history and mysteries. Third line talks about the ecosystem and maybe the cultural significance. Does that cover it? I need to ensure the poem is accurate and evokes a sense of wonder. Maybe \"ancient secrets\" is a bit vague, but it works for a poem. The last line uses \"cradle\" to show the lake\\'s role in nurturing life, and \"light of a thousand dreams\" could allude to the surrounding landscapes or the people. Let me check if there are any common poetic phrases about lakes that could be better. Alternatively, maybe mention the rift valley origin. But three lines are short, so I have to be concise.

Maybe something about the fish or the mountains around it. The third line should evoke a feeling or a lasting image, perhaps about timelessness or tranquility. I should use imagery that's vivid but concise. Let me check the syllable count to make sure it flows well. Also, need to make sure each line is a complete thought but connected. Avoid clichés, but use some poetic devices like alliteration or metaphor. Let me try a few combinations. \n",

Second line: \"Cichlids dance in the depths where sunlight dares to sink, whispering tales of the world below.\" Cichlids are unique fish there, and the sunlight sinking could refer to the clear water. Third line: \"Amidst the silence, the horizon breathes eternal, cradling the dreams of the valleys.\" This gives a sense of timelessness and connects the lake to the surrounding landscape. Does that work? Check for rhythm and flow. Maybe adjust some words for better meter. \"Whispering tales\" to \"whispers tales\" for consistency. \"Eternal\" might be a bit strong, but it conveys timelessness. Okay, that seems to fit. Let me make sure there's no factual errors. Tanganyika is indeed home to many cichlid species and is very old, so \"ancient secrets\" is appropriate. The horizon breathing eternal could be a stretch, but it's poetic. Alright, I think this works.\n",

Let me start by recalling what I know about Lake Tanganyika. It\\'s one of the largest lakes in the world, located in East Africa, shared by several countries. It\\'s known for its clear waters and the fact that it\\'s a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Also, there\\'s a lot of biodiversity there, including unique fish species.\\n\\nNow, I need to capture the essence of the lake in just three lines. The first line should probably set the scene, maybe talking about its size or beauty. Words like \"giant mirror,\" \"sapphire,\" or \"ancient\" come to mind. The second line could mention the wildlife or the surrounding environment. Maybe something about the fish or the mountains around it. The third line should evoke a feeling or a lasting image, perhaps about timelessness or tranquility. I should use imagery that\\'s vivid but concise. Let me check the syllable count to make sure it flows well. Also, need to make sure each line is a complete thought but connected. Avoid clichés, but use some poetic devices like alliteration or metaphor. Let me try a few combinations. \\n\\nFirst line: Maybe \"Lake Tanganyika, a giant mirror of sapphire, holds the secrets of ancient times.\" That uses a metaphor and mentions the lake\\'s depth and history. Second line: \"Cichlids dance in the depths where sunlight dares to sink, whispering tales of the world below.\" Cichlids are unique fish there, and the sunlight sinking could refer to the clear water. Third line: \"Amidst the silence, the horizon breathes eternal, cradling the dreams of the valleys.\" This gives a sense of timelessness and connects the lake to the surrounding landscape. Does that work? Check for rhythm and flow. Maybe adjust some words for better meter. \"Whispering tales\" to \"whispers tales\" for consistency. \"Eternal\" might be a bit strong, but it conveys timelessness. Okay, that seems to fit. Let me make sure there\\'s no factual errors. Tanganyika is indeed home to many cichlid species and is very old, so \"ancient secrets\" is appropriate. The horizon breathing eternal could be a stretch, but it\\'s poetic. Alright, I think this works.\\n', 'source': 'assistant_agent', 'type': 'AssistantMessage'}]}}, 'message_buffer': []}, 'RoundRobinGroupChatManager': {'type': 'RoundRobinManagerState', 'version': '1.0.0', 'message_thread': [{'source': 'user', 'models_usage': None, 'metadata': {}, 'content': 'Write a beautiful poem 3-line about lake tangayika', 'type': 'TextMessage'}, {'source': 'assistant_agent', 'models_usage': None, 'metadata': {}, 'content': '\\nOkay, the user wants a beautiful three-line poem about Lake Tanganyika.
